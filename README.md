# init
This project is an introduction to system and network administration, offered by the slash16 team

The Slash16 Team is a network of people who are passionate about system and network administration and/or operations development (DevOps).
They created this and two more projects (Roger-Skyline-1 and Docker).

This first project, init, gave me the opportunity to discover system and network basic commands, 
many of the services used on a server machine, as well as a few ideas of scripts that can be useful for 
SysAdmins on a daily basis.
